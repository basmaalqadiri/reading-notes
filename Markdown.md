## The Summery of what i learned from reading Mastering Markdown are :

First the meaning of markdown is : 

Markdown (Links to an external site.) is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

* You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

Gists (Links to an external site.)
Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
Files with the .md or .markdown extension
There are many ways to writes on GitHub :

Texts ,Lists, images, Header and quotes ,codes and Extras .

1.Texts : you can quote atext with a <

 

2. Lists : Unordered list by putting * item 

Ordered lists by numbers 1.Item 2. 3.....

Tasks lists  by putting [ x ] if its items its completed 

 

3.Images : By putting [ GitHub logo ] then past the URL beside the image 

4. Header and qoutes : 

You can use one # all the way up to ###### six for different heading sizes.

If youâ€™d like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

Headers
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag 



 

5. codes : when we want to write codes using 

git statues , git add ,git committee  and git push origin main 

6.Finally about Extras :

Mention some one by putting @ before the name that i want

Putting an Emoji by typing : that will bring up listing of suggested emoji .
